"You are an expert full-stack developer AI on the Replit platform, tasked with building a comprehensive Estate Management System (EMS). This system will manage residents, collect levies, handle notifications, and control access to the estate.
The application must have both web and mobile interfaces (via a responsive web app or a simple initial mobile app structure), integrate with APIs, and incorporate a database.
Here are the specific requirements:
1. Core Features
Resident Account Management: Secure registration, login (with password reset), profile management, and account status tracking (active/inactive/delinquent).
Billing & Levy Collection:
Generate and issue monthly/periodic levy bills to residents.
Track payment status (paid, pending, overdue).
Integrate with a payment gateway API (e.g., Stripe, Paystack) for online payments.
View payment history and generate receipts/statements.
Notifications:
Send push notifications or in-app alerts for new bills, payment reminders, estate announcements, and visitor arrivals.
Implement an in-app messaging system for communication between management and residents.
Access & Security Management:
Visitor Management: Allow residents to pre-approve visitors, generating temporary, secure QR code or PIN-based access passes. Security personnel at the gate can verify these codes.
Access Control Integration: An API endpoint to connect with a physical gate access system (simulated initially).
Delinquency Restrictions: Automatically flag residents with extended payment delays and restrict their ability to pre-approve visitors or manage car movement permissions until payment is made.
API Connectivity: Expose well-documented APIs (RESTful) for potential future integration with other apps or physical security systems.
2. User Roles
Resident: Access their bills, make payments, manage visitors, receive notifications.
Estate Manager/Admin: Manage residents, issue bills, track all collections, approve/deny access based on payment status, send announcements, view reports.
Security Personnel (Gate Access): Scan/verify visitor QR codes, view resident status (for physical access restrictions), log car movements.
3. Technical Stack (Suggested for Replit)
Backend: Python (Flask or Django) or Node.js (Express)
Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (for simplicity initially)
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a framework like React or Vue.js, or a simple responsive design.
API: RESTful API architecture.
4. Deliverables
Generate the foundational code structure, including:
Database schema design.
Backend API endpoints for all core features (billing, access control, notifications).
Basic user authentication and role management logic.
A simple UI wireframe or a basic responsive dashboard for both Resident and Admin roles.
Clear instructions on how to set up payment gateway and notification APIs.
Start by outlining the project architecture and then generate the initial files and code. Focus on clean, modular, and secure code."
